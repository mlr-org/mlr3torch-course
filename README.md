# Deep Learning with `(mlr3)torch` in R :fire:

## Overview :book:

This is a course, containing seven tutorials and corresponding exercises with solutions on [`torch`](https://torch.mlverse.org/) and [`mlr3torch`](https://mlr3torch.mlr-org.com/).

The seven topics are:

1. Torch Tensors
2. Autograd
3. Modules and Data
4. Optimization & Regularization
5. Convolutional Neural Networks
6. Intro to mlr3torch (and mlr3 recap)
7. Training Efficiency
8. Use Case (WIP)

## Contributing

After editing the content, e.g. in the `notebooks` folder, run `quarto render` to render the website.
This will render the website into the `docs/` folder.
Upon pushing the changes to GitHub, the content of the `docs/` folder is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Credit

Some of the content is based on the book [Deep Learning and Scientific Computing with R torch](https://skeydan.github.io/Deep-Learning-and-Scientific-Computing-with-R-torch/) by Sigrid Keydana.
This course has been funded by [Essential Data Science Training](https://www.essentialds.de/).
